# Contactus-form

This repo contains code about how to make a working contact us form using php, HTML, css.


it contains four files 


1. index.php => it contains the code for contact us form (HTML) and it includes dbconnect.php

2. dbconnect.php => it contains the code thorough which we establish a connection with database.

3. user_process.php => it contains the code which takes values of contact us form using request method then submit data using mysqli_query() to database.

 4.css => it contains css code which helps  index.php to looks more nicer.
